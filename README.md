# Nuclear Bop-It server
This is the server used in GameJam 2020 for the game Nuclear BopIt. The game currently only supports one game at a time but this could fairly easily be improved to support multiple.

The server uses the python library Eve to run as we needed something quick and simple to get up and running ASAP
